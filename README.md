# Emergency Hand Gesture Recogntion

## Overview

A real-time hand gesture recognition system using **Google MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect a specific hand gesture sequence:

1. **Open Hand**
2. **Thumb Turning In**
3. **Fingers Wrapping Around Thumb (Almost Fist)**

## Future Work

* Build an API for third party cameras to utilise the sequencing analytics
* Improve from POC and increase accuracy of gesture recognition
  * Current implementation makes use of landmark positioning
  * Mediapipe has gesture recognition in-built which may provide greater results
